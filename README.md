### Removal of old JavaScript

This fork uses downsized/simplified versions of scripts and has no support for Internet Explorer.

The result is faster and smaller download code (good for mobile networks).

Things might work in Edge 18, Firefox 50-62 and Chrome 54-68 due to one polyfill for array.flat().

### Squire vs CKEditor
The [Squire](https://github.com/neilj/Squire) implementation is not 100% compatible yet, but it shows the massive overhead of CKEditor.

Still TODO:

* support for tables (really needed?!?)
* support BIDI (really needed?!?)

|       	| normal	| min    	| gzip  	| min gzip	|
|--------	|-------:	|-------:	|------:	|--------:	|
|squire  	| 128.826	|  47.074	| 33.671	|   15.596	|
|ckeditor	|       ?	| 520.035	|      ?	|  155.916	|

CKEditor including the 7 asset requests (css,language,plugins,icons) is 633.46 KB / 180.47 KB (gzip).

To use the old CKEditor, you must enable it in /data/\_data\_/\_default\_/configs/application.ini
in the [labs] section add/edit: `use_ck_html_editor = On`

### PHP73 branch

There's a RainLoop 1.14.0 branch with only the PHP 7.3 changes at
https://github.com/the-djmaze/snappymail/tree/php73
